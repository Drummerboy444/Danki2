# Vengeance of Valhaven

Welcome to the Vengeance of Valhaven repository.

## Introduction

Vengeance of Valhaven is passion project started by a small team of devs and artists in 2019 - sadly development stopped into 2022 due to changing personal circumstances of team members.

There is a working demo [here](https://github.com/fourhorsemen-master/Vengeance-of-Valhaven/releases/tag/v1.0) which shows some of the vision for the game.

*Note that 'Danki' was a codename for Vengeance of Valhaven during development*
