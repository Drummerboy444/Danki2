The easiest way to add a dev scene is to copy an existing one. To do this:
 - Select the scene to copy
 - Hit ctrl-d to duplicate it
 - Rename it as DevScene
 - Drag it into the Scenes/Dev folder

Then in the new scene:
 - Delete the terrain gameobject which sits in Room/Level
 - Duplicate the file called {sceneName}_TerrainData from the scene you copied and put it into Scenes/Dev (similar to earlier step)
 - Drag the new terrain data file into the new scene and place under Room/Level
 - Reposition the terrain to match the props
 - Bake the navmesh by going into the Navigation tab and clicking bake

 You should have a duplicated scene (missing textures on the terrain) and you shouldn't have any red lines when you do a 'git status'.
